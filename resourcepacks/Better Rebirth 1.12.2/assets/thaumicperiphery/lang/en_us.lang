research.BASEPERIPHERY.title=Thaumic Periphery
research.BASEPERIPHERY.stage.1=The more I delve into Thaumaturgy, the more I realize that I'm only just scratching the surface of what's possible. I wonder what I could achieve by pushing Thaumaturgy to the very limit, and possibly even exploring how it interacts with other schools of magic.

research.CASTEREMBER.title=Clockwork Casting
research.CASTEREMBER.stage.1=The mystical energy source known as 'ember' can be used in many magical and mechanical devices. Perhaps I can fashion a casting gauntlet that uses ember instead of vis.
research.CASTEREMBER.stage.2=Through careful study of the aura and the nature of ember, I have managed to invent a casting gauntlet that makes use of ember instead of vis.

research.CASTERELEMENTIUM.title=Casting with Mana
research.CASTERELEMENTIUM.stage.1=There seems to be no end to the many ways in which Botanists are able to harness the power of mana. I'm sure that I could create a casting gauntlet that utilizes mana instead of vis.
research.CASTERELEMENTIUM.stage.2=Through careful study of the aura and the nature of mana, I have devised a casting gauntlet that makes use of mana instead of vis.

research.PAULDRONREPULSION.title=Pauldron of Repulsion
research.PAULDRONREPULSION.stage.1=Having grown tired of being harassed by large groups of monsters, I should look into creating something that can keep the monsters at bay and buy me time to escape tricky situations.
research.PAULDRONREPULSION.stage.2=I've drawn up designs for a pauldron that will help to keep monsters at bay. Upon being attacked by a monster at close range, all nearby monsters will be forcefully pushed away from my person. This effect will not be able to take place more than once every five seconds.

research.MALIGNANTHEART.title=Malignant Heart
research.MALIGNANTHEART.stage.1=Sometimes, offense is the best defense. I wonder if I could find a way to sacrifice my own life force to improve my ability to attack things? Studying the nature of life itself might be a good starting point.
research.MALIGNANTHEART.stage.2=I have found a way to use my own life force to increase my attack strength, although the cost is higher than I'd hoped.<BR>I've discovered that the key to utilizing life force energy lies not in the nature of life, but in the nature of undeath. Through the use of an undead heart infused with aggression and conflict, I can increase my attack strength by half at the cost of half of my maximum health.

research.MAGICQUIVER.title=Conjurer's Quiver
research.MAGICQUIVER.stage.1=As useful as bows are for dispatching foes from a safe distance, I find their need for ammunition to be most vexing. Perhaps I can use my knowledge of auromancy to find a way around this problem.
research.MAGICQUIVER.stage.2=Using concepts similar to what I used to design the caster's gauntlet, I can create a magically infused quiver that can convert vis from the aura into ethereal arrows that can be fired from most bows.<BR>Unlike a caster's gauntlet, the Conjurer's Quiver cannot draw vis directly from the aura; it must be charged using a recharge pedestal or the like. So long as I am wearing it and it has sufficient vis stored within, it will serve as a source of ammunition for bows whenever no other ammo source is present. Although the arrows it creates deal slightly less damage than physical arrows, the damage they do inflict is magical in nature, making them highly effective against armored opponents.

research.VISPHYLACTERY.title=Vis Phylactery
research.VISPHYLACTERY.stage.1=While most vis-using equipment has ample vis storage, sometimes a bit of backup charge could come in handy. An upgrade for the amulet of vis might do the trick.
research.VISPHYLACTERY.stage.2=By infusing an amulet of vis with a few amber crystals, I can create an upgraded amulet that can both charge items from the aura and store vis within itself.<BR>Instead of directly charging other items from the aura, it will charge itself and then use it's vis reserve to charge other equipment in my inventory. It will only charge itself if the local aura contains more than 50 vis.<BR>The vis phylactery can store up to 300 vis.
