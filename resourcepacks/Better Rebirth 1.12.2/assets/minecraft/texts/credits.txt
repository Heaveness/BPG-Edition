§f§3"You have done well, Champion. But, your journey does not end here... As we speak, there are far more dangers lurking around all worlds. The barrier between realms are weakening, with creatures of the night further reaching into ours. But for this victory, rest well. You have long days ahead of you. I will not envy nor pity you, instead I will congratulate you.. for your hard earned victory and celebrate your true braveness! Tell your story to others for generations to come! Take care Champion! Hopefully we will meet someday..." §3- Unknown
