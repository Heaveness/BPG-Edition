        # When they talk with you while you near them
        S:Chatting <
            Might I interest you in any spells, perhaps?
            Magic is everywhere, if you know where to look
            There is still much to be learned about the arcane arts, adventurer
            Perhaps you have learned something yourself that you wish to share?
            Studying the arcane is most fascinating, don't you think?
            The duty of Wizard is to protect their house, and their hearth
            I would like to talk about Spells
            Cataclysm destroyed most of big buildings that was here
            I remember how it feels when you lose your loved ones
            I can't imagine how long it will take to create a new spell
            Greetings, traveller. What brings you here?
            Elemental Creatures are truly dangerous!
            I've seen big white spider recently, their name is White Spiders, and they manipulate the space and time around them
            Spellcasting Witches is my terrible nightmare...
            A lot of us become simply Mad, and becoming Angry, because of how Magic affects our old bodies... someone even just stalks others in different places
            Cataclysm changed everything..
            Someone maybe will have a way to become eternal...
            Most people do not know how this feels to lose your memories sometimes...
            Is it just me, or i heard strange sound over there?
            Dear traveller, you should buy something, or i will go sleep
            My memories fade...
            Weather isn't good last days

        # When they're attacking monsters
        S:"Young Wizard Monsters" <
            You shouldn't exist!

        # When trying to talk with Young Wizards - they can say you this
        S:"Young Wizards Phrases" <
            Sorry, but i'm relaxing here!
            Spells are so great thing to use!
            As teacher says: We always know what we want, but we don't.. But what actually that means...
            Ugh... failed spell creation once more!
            It's so terrible that Elemental Monsters appearing, so i even thinking to buy Scroll of Holy Barrier for my house!
            I have nothing to say to you
            Sometimes i totally lose my memory.. what i was doing... i'm like in a time loop, but different! I can't understand this really..
            Midnight Traders are best!
            Do you have Familiar?
            I've used my last Teleportation Scroll this week! Oh no!
            If you can teach me magic i'll be glad!
