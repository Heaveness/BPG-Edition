## Ancient Warfare faction structures

**By Mohawky**

The structures you will encounter in ancient warfare are the result of six years of continuous work by myself, creating my own structures for the mod from way back in 1.6.4 and then seeking permission to use and adapt other builders works that appeared on Minecraft structure dedicated sites. Gradually a vast library of structures built up, which have now been put to good use in the 1.12.2 version of Ancient Warfare.

**Credits**

50% of all structures contained in the mod are the original work of **Mohawky** and with freely granted permission to use, in perpetuity, for the Ancient Warfare 2 Mod by Shadowmage and P3pp3rF1y.

**Other structures**

The **MCSchematics** site is a wonderful repository of builds containing thousands of hours of work by many talented people. It really needs more support than it gets. It has been a prime vehicle for providing inspiration and schematics, similarly **Planet Minecraft** and **Minecraft Schematics** sites have also provided many of them.

Over the years, the following structure builders have given permission for their great builds to be included in this mod. Many builders have provided multiple structures and many opened their archives to me to use previously unpublished structures.

Some of the structures are much adapted derivations based upon original structures published, such as Medieval Village Packs in MCSchematics by **Amarok** , and used by his kind permission.

Some walled town walls I originally created for **Formivores walled city generator** and were then heavily rebuilt and modified for AW. Used with kind permission of **GOTOLINK**, the mods current keeper.

Some of the towers used in various buildings are based on the Ravendale tower schematics series by **Alegion**.

Some structures have been adapted from the following bundle packs:

**Novv&#39;s** Medieval building pack, Planet Minecraft.

**deerassassin0424&#39;s** Medieval building pack, Planet Minecraft.

**LemonFox&#39;s** Medieval Building pack, Planet Minecraft.

**BlackCorsairs** Medieval building pack, Planet Minecraft.

**BlockMasterUk&#39;s** Medieval build pack.

**InMines** Medieval Building pack, Unknown.

&quot;Mine abandoned open cast&quot; template is based on an original schematic &quot;Very Large Open Pit Mine&quot; by **Helkellen**

&quot;Mine open cast working&quot; is a joining together of the above schematic by **Helkellen** and the &quot;Swizzel Inn&quot; schematic by **xthatsmycakex** , Minecraft Schematics.

Two builders provided the inspiration for the Buffloka (Indian) style villages - **FilaStyle84** for Indian Teepee and **AuraCloud** also for Teepees.

### Thanks very much to all builders who have graciously allowed the use of their builds!

**&quot;Hey that&#39;s my structure!&quot;**

**Apologies in advance**

I have no wish to claim or seek credit to anyone else&#39;s proud Minecraft builds or use builds without the permission of their creator.

If I have included a structure that is yours and have not included you as a credit, there is no malice intended.

If a credit is missing, I may have missed it, confused it, or forgotten where the structure came from originally. After six years of gathering structures for my own games, adapting, them, changing and altering them, it&#39;s not always possible to clearly remember where they came from originally.

Or possibly I could not track you down when I asked for permissions – in which case, where people have uploaded schematics for public use, but have not then been active on the forums for a number of years, I have assumed you would not mind the structure being used, as no one that I could contact has actually refused permission for their structures to be included.

The structure has been included because I thought it was a superb structure or piece of minecraft building, so please take it as a compliment.

It may also have been that the person who donated the structure was not the original creator.

Whatever the reason, if you would like to be credited please let me know and I will add the credit immediately. Or, if you would prefer the structure not to be used, I will delete it from the mod instead, the choice is entirely yours.
