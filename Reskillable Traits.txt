Reskillable BPG Description:

A complete overhaul of the Reskillable mod to fit with BPG Edition's gameplay style. Taken inspiration from many different RPG games, the system will take after classic Diablo's skill system.
The very core concept of this rework is to encourage teamwork while also rewarding individual's own abilities. Since this modpack was made with 2-4 players(though 2-3 players is the safest in terms of server performance).
Each player can assign 2 professions(e.g. Warrior/Gatherer), with each profession providing access to 2 sub-classes(3 classes for a future update) that they can specialize in to further provide more benefits.
Of course a player within one profession can dabble in both sub-classes evenly if chosen to receive both benefits, but only up to middle tier for both. To reach high tier traits, ome must sacrifice progression on one of the sub-class skill tree for the other.
For example, A Tinkerer profession player can put points into both Blacksmith and Engineer evenly up to mid-tier. But to reach high-tier on one of them then the other sub-class can only be raised up to low-tier.
With this concept in mind, we also want to prevent a situation where groups can get stuck in progression because someone didn't specialize in a specific sub-class. So we will have a respec system in mid-game progression to allow experimentation of builds.
To add to that we will place all of the production blocks necessary for that profession in the low tier trait section. The only difference when reaching higher tier craftsmanship will have access to higher quality and powerful versions.
With this method, players will be encouraged to experiment on what they believe to be a good composition within groups. Assigning roles and etc with each other to fit their playstyle. Since the Professions are currently made of 3 combat & 3 lifestyle jobs.
In BPG we want to encourage theorycrafting and even more so with each other, of course not to the point of being cheese strategy or overpowered builds. But the propsect of player sharing playstyles and combinations will help keep the game healthy. As long as we can keep it balanced.

What we need out of Reskillable Rework:

- Remaster all of the vanilla old traits in the stats section.
- Additional traits for the stats section.
- Merge Mining and Gathering stat together.
- Add new stat called Survival.
- Adding progressive trait bonus from leveling stats. [See trainer traits]
- A Professions and Sub-class system.
- All of the sub-class traits for those systems.
- Add config settings for majority of traits for easier number balancing.
- A functioning respec system for stats and sub-classes.
- Re-calculate the distribution of levels and xp cost for the system.
- Tying the Triumph and other mods with Reskillable for in-game rewards and personal achievement.
- Utilize many different mods within the pack together, at least the integral ones.
- Enforce Reskillable rules among many of the items and blocks.
- Look into "or," and "nor" requirements into some of the traits, items, gear, and blocks.
- Add starter kits for each sub-class that can only be used once and only unlocked once per Profession.
- Perhaps a pre-requisite trait quest completion to earn the trait's bonus.
